        <img src="images/education.jpg" style="width:100%;">
        <p>
            Education is a pillar of every country in the world. Through education,literacy levels go high and human resources are enhanced. 
            <br>
            Because of the needs of the education sector,most governments engage with NGOs in meeting their needs. This makes the process sustainable by bringing together all the stakeholders including civil society. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Undoubtedly,Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the society as well as the world as a whole. 
            <br>Few,also says “Education is the most effective way to break the cycle of poverty . 
            <br>Even today more than 20 million children still remain out of school in India. (NSS-2014). They are deprived of their right to receive an education as well as their childhood.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although,centralgovernment,through its right to education act,2009 have been making its way in enrolling and retaining children of marginalized sector.  However,according to the survey of 2014,more than 60% children dropped out before completing 3rd grade & 50% of students dropped out by 11th grade.

        <ol>
            <li><h2>Computer literacy program</h2>Computer literacy is the knowledge and ability to use computers and technology efficiently. A nation needs their citizens to have basic computer skills,because in today’s world, a country is even more dependent on computers.

            </li>
            <li><h2>Environmental initiatives & tree plantation program</h2> Environmental initiative is a new set of actions to protect the natural world. A significant economic benefit of going green is that it helps lower costs and save money . Use of renewable energy helps reduce energy consumption. A healthy planet is a necessary condition to guarantee decent work,productive enterprises and sustainable livelihoods. And therefore,Read Foundation is pretty serious about its tree plantation program. Importance of planting trees is important as they improve the live and fulfil essential needs of mankind. During photosynthesis,the trees consume carbon dioxide,and thus trees cleanse the climate by absorbing carbon dioxide from the environment and releasing oxygen. The trees cool the environment through their leaves by absorbing the sun heat. Trees clean the air by absorbing harmful chemicals such as nitrogen oxide and removing dust particles from the air by absorbing them in their leaves.
                As for that,we kept this as our one of the most important initiatives of Read Foundation.
